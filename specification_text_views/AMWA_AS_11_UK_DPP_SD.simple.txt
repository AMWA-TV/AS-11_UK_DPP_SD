# **[Work In Progress]** AS-11 UK DPP SD (MXF Program Contribution - UK DPP SD)

_This file is one rendering / view of this AMWA Specification and is a part of the Specification repository. For the latest version of the repository and issue tracker etc please refer to [https://github.com/AMWA-TV/AS-11_UK_DPP_SD/](https://github.com/AMWA-TV/AS-11_UK_DPP_SD/)_

# AS-11: Media Contribution File Formats

The AMWA AS-11 Specifications define constrained media file formats for the delivery of finished media assets to a broadcaster or publisher. Each Specification is developed for a particular business purpose.



# Purpose of the AS-11 UK DPP SD Specification

## Aims

This Specification aims to define a file format for the delivery of finished SD TV Programmes to UK [Digital Production Partnership](https://www.digitalproductionpartnership.co.uk/) (DPP) broadcasters. It aims to define:

* a vendor-neutral and broadcaster-neutral package, using open technologies for delivery of finished programming from program producers and program distributors to broadcast stations
* a package that is sufficiently simple so as to limit the scope for interoperability problems
* a self-contained & play-out ready package

## Some notes on practical use

* The content may be delivered at the broadcast bit-rate, picture format and aspect ratio, or it may be transcoded at the broadcast station to the bit-rates and formats required for particular broadcast channels. Similar transcoding may be applied to audio and captions; additionally, specific audio and caption tracks may be selected for different broadcast channels.
* The content may be pre-packaged for broadcast without further changes or it may be segmented for ease of insertion or replacement of interstitials.
* There may be more than one package per programme.
* The package may contain some pre and post roll content not for transmission.


# Understanding the Specification Blocks Tree

## Entities Summary
The Specification-writing framework used to produce this Specification has several different types of component / entity. In summary:

* Each Specification is composed of a single Top-Level **Block (B)**
* Blocks are defined by containing **Artefacts (A)** or linking directly to other Blocks
* Artefacts often refer to **Terms (T)** and **References (R)** as well as Blocks
* Blocks are sometimes described by **Notes (N)**

Each entity is identified by a unique URL.

These entities naturally form a "tree" -- a rendering / view of this is shown below. Some of the letters in brackets above are used in the tree view to identify the type of each entity.

## Conformance

An implementation complies with a Block if it complies with all of the Blocks / Artefacts from which it is constructed. "Informative" statements do not have to be complied with (details of "informative" statements are given below).

* Compliance with some Blocks is not mandatory. Such Blocks are marked with an alternative "conformance" state (such as "optional" or "recommended").
* The name / title of an entity is considered "informative", as is its "description" (if present).
* "Note" entities are considered "informative".
* Prose Artefacts are written as statements of fact. An implementation complies with one of these Artefacts if the stated fact is True for the implementation.
* Some Artefacts are "data files" such as SMPTE Metadata Registers XML files or XML Schema files. Some of these may be partially rendered below. An implementation must always fully comply with these data files.

_Note that an Artefact does not always make sense on its own: all of the Artefacts contained within a Block need to be read (in order) to understand the Block fully and correctly._

## Parameter Blocks

There are two special types of Block which allow the value of one Block to be set by another Block:

* **Parameter Key Block (K)** -- this is a Block whose value must be set elsewhere in the Specification (it effectively defines a "variable" or an "argument")
* **Parameter Value Block (V)** -- this is a Block which sets the value of a specific Parameter Key Block (K)


# The Specification Blocks Tree

[B] File Format
    [B] Core MXF constraints
        Conformance: mandatory
        [B] MXF File Format
            Conformance: mandatory
            [A] The file conforms to <SMPTE ST 377:2004>.
            [N] N030
                [A] This does not prohibit the use of MXF version 1.3 (<SMPTE ST 377-1:2011>) for SD files. SMPTE encourages users to apply the most recent edition of standards where possible.
        [B] Operational pattern 1a
            Conformance: mandatory
            [A] The file conforms to <SMPTE ST 378:2004>.
            [N] N011
                [A] The file must be labelled as OP1a in the Operational Pattern property of all Partition Packs and the Preface Set, as required by <SMPTE ST 377-1:2011> in Section 7.1 and Annex A, respectively.
        [B] Closed Complete Header
            Conformance: mandatory
            [A] The <Header Partition> is "Closed" and "Complete".
            [N] N014
                [A] Byte 15 of the Header Partition Pack Key must be set to 04h and all Header Metadata must have correct values. Hence 'Distinguished Values' cannot be used for 'Best Effort' properties. See Section 6.2.3 of <SMPTE ST 377-1:2011> for a full explanation.
            [N] N045
                [A] Late delivery of a file is the term used to describe a workflow where playout (broadcast) of a file starts before the file transfer from supplier to broadcaster has completed. To support late delivery a broadcaster must be able to trust the metadata that is contained at the beginning of the file.
        [B] Header Metadata KLV Fill
            Conformance: recommended
            [A] When first created, the file includes a <KLV Fill> item of at least 8192 bytes in total length following the <Header Metadata>.
            [N] N002
                [A] The "total length" is of the entire item and includes the length of the Key and Length fields.
            [N] N025
                [A] The extra space afforded by the KLV Fill allows Header Metadata to be edited and added to without rewriting the entire file.
        [B] Generic Container
            Conformance: mandatory
            [A] The file uses the <Generic Container>.
        [B] Internal Essence
            Conformance: mandatory
            [A] The <Generic Container> is internal to the file.
        [B] Strict Frame Wrapping
            Conformance: mandatory
            [A] The <Generic Container> uses <Frame Wrapping>.
            [A] If the <Generic Container> contains <Picture Essence> then the related <Edit Unit> duration is equal to the duration of a video frame of the <Picture Essence>.
            [N] E8
                [A] For example, this means that if the <Picture Essence> is field-encoded then each <Edit Unit> contains the data assosiated with both of the video fields for a video frame.
        [B] One-to-one Track mapping
            Conformance: mandatory
            [A] Each <Essence Track> in the <Top-Level File Package> is referenced by exactly one <Essence Track> in the <Material Package>.
            [N] No division/combination of Audio Channels between Sound Tracks
                [A] This prohibits:
                    
                    * the mapping of audio channels from a multi-channel Sound Track in a Source Package to single-channel Sound Tracks in the Material Package
                    * the mapping of audio channels from single-channel Sound Tracks in a Source Package to multi-channel Sound Tracks in the Material Package
                    
                    which is specified in Annex E of SMPTE ST 382:2007.
    [B] MXF constraints for intra-frame coded Picture Essence
        Conformance: mandatory
        [B] Index precedes Essence
            Conformance: mandatory
            [A] The file contains a complete <Index Table> before the <Essence>.
            [N] N007
                [A] It's generally considered good MXF practice to have one 'thing' per Partition, so you'd have separate Partitions for Header Metadata, Essence, and Index Tables. This isn't a requirement but following best practice is encouraged.
            [N] N020
                [A] The Index Table could be placed in the Header Partition, its own Body Partition or in a Body Partition with the Essence. Indeed it could be distributed across all three of these locations. Decoders need to be able to cope with all of these posibilities.
        [B] Index all Essence
            Conformance: mandatory
            [A] The <Index Table> indexes every <Edit Unit> of every <Essence Element> in the file.
        [B] Single Essence Partition
            Conformance: mandatory
            [A] The <Generic Container> is entirely contained in exactly one <Partition>.
            [N] N007
                [A] It's generally considered good MXF practice to have one 'thing' per Partition, so you'd have separate Partitions for Header Metadata, Essence, and Index Tables. This isn't a requirement but following best practice is encouraged.
            [N] N020
                [A] The Index Table could be placed in the Header Partition, its own Body Partition or in a Body Partition with the Essence. Indeed it could be distributed across all three of these locations. Decoders need to be able to cope with all of these posibilities.
    [B] ST 386 with D-10 625i25 at 50 Mbps
        Conformance: mandatory
        [A] The file conforms to <SMPTE ST 386:2004> where the <Picture Essence> operates at "50 Mbit/s" using a "625/50 system".
        [N] N008
            [A] All aspects of <SMPTE ST 386:2004> must be followed. In addition to the mapping of the AES3 Sound Essence and D-10 Picture Essence, it also covers other things such as Index Tables and KAG size.
        [N] N009
            [A] The constraints on Picture Essence encoding here imply a "level" of "main".
        [N] N023
            [A] The KLV Alignment Grid of any Partition containing an Essence Container must be 512.
        [N] N026
            [A] While not strictly specified, the Picture Essence has 608 lines (576 of active picture plus 32 of vertical interval), as is conventional for D-10 pictures and which is alluded to in <SMPTE ST 365:2001>.
        [N] N042
            [A] <SMPTE ST 386:2004> specifies that there is exactly one Sound Track in each of the <Material Package> and <Top-Level File Package>.
        [N] N053
            [A] Standard Definition content can have an aspect ratio of 16/9 or 4/3.
    [B] Simple channel numbering for 8-channel AES3 element
        Conformance: mandatory
        [A] The "channel number in the <8-channel AES3 element> is the "Audio Track Number" defined in <EBU R 48> and <EBU R 123>.
    [B] AS-11 Core DM
        Conformance: mandatory
        [A] The file contains exactly one instance of <DM_AS_11_Core DM Scheme>.
            [B] DM_AS_11_Core DM Scheme
                The core DM Scheme for AS-11 for editorial details
                [A] This <DM Scheme> is identified by <DM_AS_11_Core> (the <DM Scheme Label>) and has the following members: <DM_AS_11_Core_Framework> (the <DM Framework>).
                    [B] DM_AS_11_Core
                        [A] http://vm-1274-user.virt.ch.bbc.co.uk/as/block/500L/artefacts/Labels.xml

            [B] Constrained Static DM Track
                [A] A <Constrained Static DM Track> is a <Static Track (DM)> in the <Material Package> that contains a <Sequence>, which contains exactly one <DM Segment>, which strongly references an instance of a <DM Framework>.
                [N] N039
                    [A] The "Track Name" property of an <Constrained Static DM Track> does not identify the <DM Scheme> whose <DM Framework> it references. In the absence of other requirements for "Track Name", it is suggested that files use a value corresponding to the <DM Scheme> used in the track, e.g. "AS_11_Core", "AS_11_UKDPP".
        [N] N051

In the absence of other requirements for "Track Name", it is suggested that files use a value corresponding to the <DM Scheme> used in the track, e.g. "AS_11_Core", "AS_11_UKDPP".
        [N] N051
            [A] Repetition of Header Metadata in the Footer Partition is not considered to be another instance of any of the components of that Header Metadata.

        Conformance: mandatory
        [A] The file contains exactly one <Program Segmentation Track>.
            [B] Program Segmentation Track
                [A] A <Program Segmentation Track> is a <Timeline Track> that contains a <Sequence> that is composed of zero or more <Filler> objects and one or more <DM Segment> objects.
                [A] Each <DM Segment> object in the <Program Segmentation Track> represents, and aligns with, a region of program content in the <Source Essence>.
                [A] Each <Filler> object in the <Program Segmentation Track> represents, and aligns with, a region of non-program content in the <Source Essence>.
                [N] N038
                    [A] The "Track Name" property of the <Program Segmentation Track> does not identify the segmentation metadata scheme. In the absence of other requirements for "Track Name", it is suggested that files use a value corresponding to the <DM Scheme> used in the track, e.g.  "AS_11_Segmentation".
                [N] N040
                    [A] The start and end timecodes for program regions, commonly referred to as "start of material" (som) and "end of material" (eom), can be determined based on the location of <DM Segment> objects on the <Program Segmentation Track> relative to the adjacent <Timecode Track> in the <Material Package> that contains the <Program Segmentation Track>.
                [N] N048
                    [A] Examples of non-programme content include: black, ident, clock.
        [A] This <Track> is in the <Material Package>.

                        [A] http://vm-1274-user.virt.ch.bbc.co.uk/as/block/505F/artefacts/Types.xml
        [N] N049
            [A] The <Track> can be identified by an MXF reader by the presence of <DM Segment> objects that each strongly reference an instance of the "DM_AS_11_Segmentation_Framework" <DM Framework>.
        [N] N051
            [A] Repetition of Header Metadata in the Footer Partition is not considered to be another instance of any of the components of that Header Metadata.
    [B] Timecode constraints
        Conformance: mandatory
        [B] Timecode Track Presence
            Conformance: mandatory
            [A] The <Material Package> contains exactly one <Timecode Track>.
            [N] N021
                [A] The Timecode properties must always properly match the content of the MXF file. This means that "Rounded Timecode Base" and "Drop Frame" need to be set appropriately.
            [N] N024
                [A] This Timecode Track provides "Synthetic Timecode" because its Timecode is "generated" from a single "Start Timecode" value that is associated with the beginning of the Material Package. This means that the Timecode is necessarily continuous throughout the entire playback of the MXF file.
        [B] Timecode Track Precedence
            Conformance: mandatory
            [A] The <Timecode Track> in the <Material Package> defines the authoritative program timecode.
            [N] N022
                [A] The authority of the Timecode Track in the Material Package needs to be respected by all components of a system that handles the file.
    [B] Miscellaneous Content Constraints
        Conformance: mandatory
        AS-11 v1.1 and its shims included some content constraints, which perhaps don't belong in the file format Specification. They are included here. 
        [B] AFD present
            Conformance: mandatory
            [A] The "Active Format Descriptor" property of the <Picture Essence Descriptor> is present in the file.
            [N] N036
                [A] Section G.2.5 of <SMPTE ST 377-1:2011> describes compliant encoder and decoder behavior with respect to <SMPTE ST 2016-1:2009>.
            [N] N037
                [A] Section G.2.5 of <SMPTE ST 377-1:2011> requires that the value of the "Active Format Descriptor" property be constant for the duration of the associated <Picture Track>.
        [B] AFD 9 10 14
            Conformance: mandatory
            [A] The 4-bit AFD encoded in the "Active Format Descriptor" property of the <Picture Essence Descriptor> is one of the following decimal values: 9 or 10 or 14.
            [N] N036
                [A] Section G.2.5 of <SMPTE ST 377-1:2011> describes compliant encoder and decoder behavior with respect to <SMPTE ST 2016-1:2009>.
            [N] N037
                [A] Section G.2.5 of <SMPTE ST 377-1:2011> requires that the value of the "Active Format Descriptor" property be constant for the duration of the associated <Picture Track>.
            [N] N047
                [A] The <AFD> (as it is used here, where only a very restricted set of values are permitted) can be considered as telling the decoder what video transformations it can reasonably make when displaying the video. For example when displaying the video on a "problematic" screen the decoder could wish to "zoom and crop" or "pillarbox" or "letterbox" the video as appropriate (where a "problematic" screen could be one where the dimensions of the screen mean that if the video is displayed full-screen it does not have the stated "aspect ratio").
        [B] 4 audio channels
            Conformance: mandatory
            [A] Only the channels in the <8-channel AES3 element> with a "channel number" of 1, 2, 3 or 4 are valid.
        [B] R48 2a customisation
            Conformance: mandatory
            [A] If the value of <AS_11_Audio_Track_Layout> is Layout_EBU_R_48_2a then each channel in the <8-channel AES3 element> with a "channel number" of 3 or 4 contains digital silence.
        [B] No Closed Captions
            Conformance: mandatory
            [A] The file does not contain closed captions.
    [B] Miscellaneous DM constraints (UKDPP SD)
        Conformance: mandatory
